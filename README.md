# Just for fun

I decided to work on this one afternoon to see if in the future games can be played with a web browser using phone sensors. Much like a wii console. Being able to rotate a cube in real time using the phone's gyroscope and accelerometer. Using socket.io to connect phone sensors to a browser. This uses heroku servers as a middle man, ideally this would be per to per (when there is proper support for this).
